# ATS-Temptory
For supporting template-based programming

ATS-Temptory can be seen as a repackaging of ATS-Postiats.
  
Compared with ATS-Postiats, the core library of ATS-Temptory is
completely re-written from scratch so as to unleash some of great
powers of templates in support of code sharing and reuse.  It is no
exaggeration to say that the style of template-based programming as is
supported in ATS-Temptory is disruptive. One might compare this style of
programming to OOP during its early days.
