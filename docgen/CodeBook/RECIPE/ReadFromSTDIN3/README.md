# Read from STDIN (3)

If you have not yet read [ReadFromSTDIN2](./../ReadFromSTDIN2), please
do so first.

The code in this example does essentially the same as the code in
[ReadFromSTDIN2](./../ReadFromSTDIN2) except for using the alarm signal
(SIGALRM) to prevent the possible scenario of waiting indefinitely for
the user's input.

Happy programming in ATS!!!
