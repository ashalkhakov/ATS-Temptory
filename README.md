# ATS-Temptory
For supporting template-based programming

ATS-Temptory can be seen as a repackaging of ATS-Postiats.
  
Compared with ATS-Postiats, the core library of ATS-Temptory is
completely re-written from scratch so as to better facilitate the
use of templates in support of code sharing and reuse. It is is clear
to see that the style of template-based programming as is supported in
ATS-Temptory is of disruptive nature. One might even compare this
style of programming to OOP during its early days.

At this point, I am taking a break from implementing ATS-Xanadu.  I
plan to concentrate on developing ATS-Temptory. In particular, I would
like to use ATS-Temptory as a vehicle to demonstrate that some of the
great powers of template-based programming in helping greatly increase
programming productivity.
