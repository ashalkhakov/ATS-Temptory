# The Doublet Puzzle

**Doublets** is a word game invented by Lewis Carroll (1832-1898), the
author of children's classic "Alice in Wonderland".  For a description
of this game, please visit, for instance, the
[link](http://www.logicville.com/doublets.htm).

Given two words recognized in a chosen dictionary, they are said to be
one-step connected if they differ precisely at one position in their
spellings. Clearly, two connected words must contain the same number
of characters. Two given words W1 and W2 are many-step connected if a
sequence of words beginning with W1 and ending with W2 can be found
such that any two consecutive words in this sequence are one-step
connected. The game Doublets basically asks the player to tell whether
two given words are many-step connected. For instance. `head` and
`tail` form a doublet as is shown by the following sequence:

head, held, hell, tell, tall, tail
